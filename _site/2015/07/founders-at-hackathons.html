<span class="figcaption_hack">Our team at CODEX Hackathon: a museum curator, a writer-translator, MIT grad
student and a start-up founder.</span></p>

<p>As a startup founder, you’re constantly making decisions about how to spend your
scarce time. Weekend hackathons can be a hard sell from this perspective: two
whole days that are seemingly neither on your company’s critical path nor a
break from sitting at a computer.</p>

<p>But after spending a weekend in late June at the <a href="http://codexhackathon.com/">CODEX
Hackathon</a> in San Francisco, I think I’m a convert.
Hackathons can be a wonderful way for founders to re-kindle their creativity and
gain a lot of unexpected professional insights too.</p>

<p>CODEX was weekend-long event dedicated to hacking literature, which is already
cool and creative to start. But what really won me over was that the organizers
used the sponsorship funding they raised to fly in interesting participants
rather than simply offer a large cash prize pot. As a result, the crowd was
varied: MIT researchers, language translators, museum curators, Google
engineers.</p>

<p>In my idealized dreams, I* *thought CODEX would be an opportunity for my startup
<a href="http://www.cloudstitch.com/">Cloudstitch</a> to find eager users of our product
(and it was — I’ll post about the cool things we built another time). Our
company, which is in the current Y Combinator batch, helps developers power
websites with Google Spreadsheets instead of databases, which is a perfect fit
for prototypes and hackathons.</p>

<p>So our plan, looking forward to the event, was all about *build build build. *We
prepared some spreadsheet-powered <a href="http://www.cloudstitch.com/project-templates/recovering-the-classics-api/api">literary
APIs</a>
and example starter projects, like an <a href="http://apps.cloudstitch.io/project-templates/book-cover-wall/">infinite wall of
books</a> and a
<a href="http://www.cloudstitch.com/project-templates/featured-guests">conference attendee
widget</a> in hopes
they would serve as useful launching pads.</p>

<p>But looking back at the event afterwards, was really surprised me was how much I
personally got out of the experience as a founder*. *So here are four reasons
why you, as a founder, should consider going to a hackathon.</p>

<h3 id="1-youll-be-reminded-creative-goals-not-technology-details-are-whats">1. You’ll be reminded creative goals, not technology details, are what’s</h3>
<p>important</p>

<p>Each company has their brand of hammer and spends time finding people who have
the right nails to hit. And a hackathon reminds you that this is a very narrow
mentality.</p>

<p>Despite being part of the kickoff-pitch lineup of talks in the beginning, I
couldn’t help but see a bit of comedy in our situation. We wanted everyone to
use Cloudstitch to power their prototype’s data with spreadsheets. MailChimp
wanted everyone’s prototype to send mail to people. Dropbox wanted people to use
the Dropbox API. I don’t mean this in a cynical way: our job as sponsors is to
provide an arsenal of tools and support for anyone who wants to use them. And we
all did a great job of that, I think.</p>

<p>But making the rounds and chatting up people to see if you can help is a
powerful reminder that, at heart, creativity, not tooling, is the powerful
driver of the innovation. The goals you admire while making the rounds have
nothing to do with implementation. “I want to help book worms find love based on
their reading list” “I want to help people finish the books they’ve started” “I
want to connect people to the stories that take place in their own cities”</p>

<p>If you’ve fallen into the trap of clutching your hammer and looking for nails—
and I certainly have — a hackathon is a vitamin shot back into that creative
space where technology is simply a detail in service of creative goals.</p>

<h3 id="2-youll-have-a-chance-to-use-your-product-in-an-unexpected-way">2. You’ll have a chance to use your product in an unexpected way</h3>

<p>Building on the importance-of-creativity thought, you can almost be guaranteed
that the way you thought people would want to use your project will not be how
they actually use it. This is probably somewhat true of products in general, but
to get to see it in the condensed space of a weekend is refreshing and
eye-opening as a founder. At the very least, you will leave with the excited
feeling of a parent seeing their child do something they never directly taught
them.</p>

<p>Take the team I spent the weekend hacking with: <a href="https://twitter.com/digitalanika">Anika
Gupta</a> of MIT, writer-translator <a href="https://twitter.com/arendse">Arendse
Lund</a>, and Eric Gardner of Getty. We built an eBook
that layered rich ambient experience onto plain text: subtle background images
and maps behind the text; ambient music and sound effects; photos of relevant
places in the margin. All of it was meant to subtly enrich the feeling of story
immersion without going too far and making it feel like a magazine. <a href="http://egardner.github.io/Baskervilles/chapters/ch05.html">You can
read a demo of the Hound of the Baskervilles we made
here</a>.</p>

<p><span class="figcaption_hack">I never would have thought our Spreadsheet-based development platform would have
relevance to eBook authoring.</span></p>

<p>Now all this was powered by nothing more than the raw text of the book combined
with a very clever and simple spreadsheet. In one column you paste a sentence in
the book, and in the next column you paste what kind of rich media accompaniment
that sentence should queue up for the reader. But if you asked me the week
before if Cloudstitch had relevance to eBook authoring, I probably would have
quickly said, “No — we’re really focused on people who have structured data to
publish”.</p>

<h3 id="3-youll-get-to-see-many-different-pitching-and-demo-styles">3. You’ll get to see many different pitching and demo styles</h3>

<p>I think the pitches at the end of a hackathon are far more useful to observe
than those at a pitch competition. First of all, hackathons presentations are
closer to what a founder does than a pitch competition because there’s sweat and
love involved. You’re excited about an idea, have worked hard to prove it out,
and now you want to make the case to others in an environment crowded with
others doing the same thing.</p>

<p>Secondly, hackathon pitches are essentially marketing pitches, whereas pitch
competition pitches are heavily business-plan focused. If you subscribe to the
Dave McClure school of thought, you’ll find way more utility watching
marketing-style pitches.</p>

<p>In the final hour or two of any hackathon, you’ll see a range of presentations.
Slick pitches based entirely on design mockups. Data-driven pitches that argue
for the feasibility of a product. Demo-based pitches. Slide-driven pitches.
Narrative-driven pitches. Demos that crash. Demos that leave eveyone with tears
of laughter. And there is guaranteed to be someone trying to sound like Steve
Jobs, with intonations and pauss (identifying this person definitely be
incorporated into some sort of hackathon drinking game).</p>

<p>You probably fall into one of the pitch categories above. It is important that
you occasionally get the chance to see many different pitch styles together so
that you can reflect on your own style.</p>

<h3 id="4-your-memory-of-the-event-doubles-as-reminder-of-how-important-it-is-to-finish">4. Your memory of the event doubles as reminder of how important it is to finish</h3>
<p>your product and ship it</p>

<p>The group emotion of a hackathon project roughly follows this arc:</p>

<ul>
  <li>**25% Milepost: **“Okay, it’s becoming clear we need to limit our scope…”</li>
  <li>**50% Milepost: **“This is really turning into a cool prototype.. now if only we
can actually get it to work”</li>
  <li>**75% Milepost: **“Wow, just think if we followed through on this! So many
people could use it”</li>
  <li><strong>While saying goodbye:</strong> “So cool to meet you guys — let’s really stay in touch
and see if we can work on this!”</li>
  <li><strong>Two weeks later</strong>: “Gosh…if only there was time in the day to finish that up.”</li>
</ul>

<p>And that’s just fine. Most hackathon projects are destined to be Tibetan sand
paintings. Beautiful collaborations that arise through hard work and then, in an
instant, are left for the wind.</p>

<p><span class="figcaption_hack">Most hackathon projects are destined to be Tibetan sand paintings.</span></p>

<p>*But your startup must not be a sand painting. *So let the memory of “gosh, if
only we had time to finish that hackathon project” be a powerful reminder that
it’s the things we ship — not build — that create a lasting company. Your
professional life as a founder is the sum of how you spend each week, and you
must make sure that those weeks are spent not just starting things, but
finishing them too.</p>
