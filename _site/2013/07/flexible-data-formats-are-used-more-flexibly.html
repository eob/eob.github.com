You might say there are roughly two schools of thought when it comes to
information modeling and storage: *schema-based storage* and *self-describing
storage*.

In schema-based storage, all items of a given type must conform to an external
schema that describes the way each item is allowed to look. In a database, this
schema is your table definitions. In a spreadsheet, it is your column headers.
Sometimes you have to define the schema before you start entering items
(database), other times you can easily edit the schema as you go (spreadsheet).
But in both cases, changing the schema applies to all items: if you add a "Pet
Name" to a customer relations spreadsheet, all customers now have that field.

In self-describing storage, no global schema needs to exist. Instead, each item
stores its own schema. This means that a lot of information is repeated,
compared to schema-based storage, but it also means that each item can be
understood without any other knowledge. It also means each item can have unique
customizations: that "Pet Name" property can exist on just one customer record
without having to add it to all records.
-->

<p>Proponents of self-describing storage cite this ability to uniquely tailor the
information stored to each item as one of the style’s big benefits. Adding
“one-off” properties to items, they claim, is a natural need of information
storage.</p>

<p>But is it?</p>

<p>Well, here’s a short analysis I did the other morning that provides some
evidence to help answer that question. I took about 1,800 datasets that I
scraped from visualizations on the web and looked that property coverage for
each property in the dataset. Let’s define the <em>property coverage</em> for property
P as the number of items that have property P divided by the total number of
items in the dataset. Property coverage of 1 means every item has the property.
Property coverage of 0.5 means half of the items do.</p>

<p>Some of the datasets for these visualizations were authored in JSON, a self
describing format. Others were authored using Google Spreadsheets, a
schema-based format. If customizing items with one-off properties is truly one
of the empirical benefits (not just claimed benefits) of self-describing
storage, then we should expect to see <em>more</em> low-coverage properties in the
JSON datasets.</p>

<p>And here is the graph with the results:</p>

<p><img style="width: 593px; border: none; -webkit-box-shadow: none; -webkit-border-radius: 0;" src="/images/posts/property-coverage.png" alt="Property Coverage" /></p>

<p>It’s nicely split into three general segments: authors who use JSON tend to
create more properties with 0-50% coverage. Between 50% and 70% it’s a wash.
And spreadsheet authors tend to use more properties with between 70% and 100%
coverage.</p>

<p>While you can’t make any strong claims from this data, it does suggest that
one-off (low coverage) properties are actually used in datasets in the wild.
And if this chart generalizes, then users of self-describing formats make use
of low coverage properties more often than users of schema-based formats,
supporting the idea that this is one of the benefits to the approach in
practice, as well as theory.</p>
