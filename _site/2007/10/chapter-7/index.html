  <p>Woah, it’s been a while. I’m skipping Chapter 6, which is going to be on
RESTful design (and possibly ActiveResource if I can pull it off without
being too reference book-y). So I’m waiting until the official Rails 2.0
release and moving on ahead without it.</p>

  <p>I guess W. Web will have to travel back in time to make up the gap in the
story. One thing I’m going to have to determine soon: just where is this Web
character going to end up? It’s apparent from Chapter 7: a conversation is
about to take place, a plot to conspire. More to come…</p>

  <p>For now, Web has teleported past untold events of Chapter 6 right into the
basement of a smoky pub, waiting for Rusty.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Web sat waiting in a booth at the back of the smoky pub, staring at the aged
carving in the wood above his table.</p>

<p align="center"><b>LOKE ERST YE THENK, AND BE YE THE WOLRDE</b></p>

<p>And the phrase beneath it, in the same ornate style but newer, he thought,
given the brighter color of the wood bezel.</p>

<p align="center"><b>FRIDAY NIGHT FISH AND CHIPS SPECIAL</b></p>

<p>The pub was a strange maze of tables and shadows, wood and brick columns
holding up the floors above. It was underneath a building holding commercial
space, an old wine cellar that used to belong to a distributer on the seventh
floor. Before that it was a factory floor for a parachute company, and even
before that it was rumored to have been an underground alchemy supply shop.</p>

<p>Now it was a pub. A damp, earthen smell was permeated under the sounds and
odors of fried fish and pipe smoke.</p>

<p>“Hi! My name is AJ and I’ll be your server today! Is there anything I can get
you to drink?”</p>

<p>Web thought the waitress looked out of place in this old tavern.  She beamed at
him waiting his reply with her spiked up neon blue hair, a shining pink plastic
halter top and costume-like makeup. She was balancing a tray of empty pint
glasses on one hand and a skateboard beneath her feet.</p>

<p>“Actually liquids tend to give me a short.  Still some old ISDN lines in
here,” Web said, patting his stomach, “Could I just have some chips? You
know what, throw in the fish, too.”</p>

<p>“Sure thing.  No liquids, fish, chips, coming right up,” she said as she
rolled away on her skateboard.</p>

<p>From afar web could see the dim outline of the matre d’ pointing a group of
people toward his table. He recognized Rusty from before, along with two others
he didn’t know. He stood up to shake their hands as they approached the table.</p>

<p>“Web, it’s good to see you again!  Let me introduce you to my friend Gr–”</p>

<p>“Napkin!” AJ cut through the group of people on her skateboard and left Web
with a napkin in his outstretched hand.</p>

<p>”..Schema, and Matz,” Rusty continued unfazed. Web gave each a hearty greeting
and the four sat down in the booth.  Before the newcomers even had time to pick
up their menus, AJ was back, tossing a plate down on the table.</p>

<p>“Plate!,” AJ’s voice trailed past as she skated without slowing, the empty plate left
rattling in a circular motion on the table.</p>

<p>Matz looked at the spinning plate and inspected the cover of the menu closely,</p>

<p>“How strange. I’ve heard of these new places. What did you order?”</p>

<p>“I got the f–”</p>

<p>“Fish, no liquids!” AJ was flying by on her skateboard in the opposite
direction this time. She managed a perfect shot from four feet away, the fish
landed square on the far side of the plate and didn’t even slide a centimeter.</p>

<p>“Fish. And chips,” Web replied, starting to worry about how his knife and fork
would be delivered to him.</p>
