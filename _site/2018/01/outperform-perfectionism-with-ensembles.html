  <div class="post-content">
    <p>Machines outperform humans at a million small tasks, but they lack any
understanding of how those tasks fit together. That fractured competence can
pose a big problem for the design of large data processing pipelines.</p>

<p>To get a computer to do anything well, you have to break your task into pieces
and then refine each piece until you’re in danger of overcommitting yourself to
some set of assumptions.</p>

<p>Consider how you might sketch a data pipeline that processes photos of legal
documents:</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*ZpRvSdHzGeu6eoZhvDqK9g.png" alt="" />
<span class="figcaption_hack">Big picture diagram of a pipeline for document understanding. Assumptions you
commit to in the early stages of the pipeline stay with you forever… impacting
how well you do at the end of the pipeline.</span></p>

<p>Component 1 might remove noise and background, Component 2 converts the image
into text, and Component 3 tries to understand the text. Each of these
components <em>itself</em> further decomposes into hundreds of small engineering
decisions.</p>

<p>If I asked you to build this pipeline, it would seem reasonable to approach your
construction literally: building one image processing stage, and one text
extraction stage, and one text understanding stage. Your system would end up
looking just like the diagram.</p>

<p>But consider how dangerously the assumptions you commit to interact if you do
that. Each small assumption made in Component 1 carries forward in its output to
Component 2, and then Component 3, forever limiting the upper bound on
performance downstream.</p>

<h3 id="conjunction-dysfunction">Conjunction dysfunction</h3>

<p>At heart, the problem is that yield at each <strong>Step N</strong> is dependent upon the
yield at <strong>Step N-1</strong> (and therefore transitively upon all steps before it).
It’s a data version of the “pipeline problem” universities face with respect to
underrepresented groups in certain fields of education.</p>

<p>In a serial pipeline, outcomes in early steps compound their influence over all
steps that come after. You end up with what you might call <em>conjunction
dysfunction</em>: a situation where the performance of your system as a whole
depends upon every component getting everything right.</p>

<p>So if you implement your data pipeline just like the diagram above, its
performance is going to be heavily impacted by how long it is. The probability
that some piece of input is correctly processed is (avg_yield) ^
(num_components):</p>

<p><span class="figcaption_hack">LaTeX’s seldom-used \sad_equals operator. The cold hard math of solving for the
80% case at each stage of a long data processing pipeline. At 80% average yield,
it only takes the conjunction of 7 components to dip below 20% overall
performance!</span></p>

<p>Faced with this, one strategy is to say:</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>“Well, I’ll plan on doing my best when implementing each component!”</em><br /> This
is equivalent to improving avg_yield. But as the length of your pipeline adds
up, you just can’t run away from harsh reality of multiplying probabilities.
Let’s assume your pipeline has this conjunctive property and each component on
the pipeline performs with 80% accuracy. It only takes a conjunction of 7
components to render your pipeline’s accuracy only 20%!</li>
</ul>

<p>So instead you might say:</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>“Fine, I’ll limit the length of my pipeline. Simplify things.”</em>This is
equivalent to decreasing the exponent, num_components. But simplification is
often either too hard or too time intensive. It requires you to outsmart the
problem you’re dealing with. And the whole reason we’re in this mess is because
we’re trying to solve a hard problem.</li>
</ul>

<p>So here’s a different approach…</p>

<h3 id="increasing-average-yield-with-ensembles-of-good-enough">Increasing average yield with Ensembles of “Good Enough”</h3>

<p>Here’s an alternative to spending your time creating the One Big Perfect Model:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Create multiple small models. Take a different approach with each. Aim for being
“good enough”.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It’s often orders of magnitude easier to score a B than an A. So relax, man! Aim
to be a B student…. but **do it over and over again, with a different route each
time. **Then, create a **Picker **function that looks at the results of all
these “Good Enough” models and selects the right result.</p>

<p>If you assume the <strong>Picker</strong> merely selects the right model (rather than merges
their output), the performance of an Ensemble of Good Enough becomes:</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*Eq-shijnLHk216lA5Oc1kg.png" alt="" />
<span class="figcaption_hack">The probability your Ensemble of “Good Enough” is correct is the probability
that one of your Good Enough Models is correct times the probability that your
picker selects the right answer.</span></p>

<p>You can actually argue that the ensemble performance is better than this because
you implemented each model with a different strategy. They won’t all fail in the
same way, meaning they’ll correctly perform on different subsets of your data.
So if your <strong>Picker</strong> works well enough, the performance of the ensemble is more
than the performance of its best performing component.</p>

<p>So here’s my hand-wavy claim about data pipelines: the moment some component
becomes “Good Enough”, your time <em>might be</em> better spent switching to the happy
math of an ensemble of Good Enough rather than optimizing every last piece into
the headwinds of conjunction disfunction.</p>

<h3 id="real-world-example-detecting-and-decoding-qr-codes">Real world example: detecting and decoding QR codes</h3>

<p>Here’s a real world example of this approach from last week.</p>

<p>Our team at <a href="http://www.instabase.com/">Instabase</a> needed to validate an
enormous collection of documents stamped with QR codes, but the image quality of
these documents was extremely variable.</p>

<p>Scouring the literature, it became apparent that there are quite a few
strategies for locating a QR code in 3D space so you can transform it into a
proper square image to pass to a QR decoding module. But we ran into a problem:
given the variance in image quality we had, some of these approaches weren’t as
universal as they claimed to be.</p>

<p>Should we expand upon them? Add more heuristic tricks? Maybe more image cleanup
in the pre-processing step?</p>

<p>Enter the Ensemble of Good Enough. Here are just a few of the Good Enough
approaches we pursued:</p>

<p><span class="figcaption_hack">Three strategies for locating the position of a QR code in an image (which may
be warped or skewed or otherwise distorted). Importantly, all three methods may
yield many guesses. Sometimes hundreds.</span></p>

<p>The beautiful thing about QR codes is that you know when you are correct because
the decoder fails to work if you aren’t.</p>

<p>That means a QR ensemble’s <strong>Picker</strong> function is perfect. If any model is
correct, it will pick it, rendering the performance of the ensemble a beautiful:</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*_q5dA81N9eWzo7GWaujrMg.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Using that model of performance as our guiding metric, we were able to have a
fun time pursuing a variety of approaches rather than fighting the diminishing
returns of trying to make a single approach work across the board. A win for
performance and morale.</p>

<h3 id="takeaway-approach-life-probabilistically">Takeaway: Approach life probabilistically</h3>

<p>These kinds of things are always situation dependent. The fact that a QR
ensemble’s <strong>Picker</strong> function is perfect makes this a bit of an unfair anecdote
in favor of this approach.</p>

<p>But I think there is a general takeaway that extends beyond even ensembles to
programming in general:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Serial pipelines become brittle with length, as errors cascade from earlier
steps down to later ones.</li>
  <li>Most of the code we write, when you think about it, is really a long serial
pipeline. The state at each step depends upon the state emitted by the prior
step.</li>
  <li>Any time you find yourself fighting complexity. Ask yourself if your standards
are too high. Instead of doing perfectly one time, why not aim for Good Enough
multiples times? Roll the dice a bit. Then you’ve just got to figure out a way
to merge the results.</li>
</ul>
