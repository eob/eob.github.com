<p>Here are some links to various open-source projects I've been a part of.</p>

<h2>Web Toolkits</h2>

<ul class="projects thinglist">

  <li><h3><a href="http://www.github.com/cts/" class="project">Cascading
      Treesheets (CTS)</a></h3> <p><b>Cascading Treesheets does for web
  structure what CSS does for web style.</b> It is a lightweight
declarative annotation layer which helps you merge, split, and remap web
content.</p>

  <li><h3><a href="http://embeddedjs.com/" class="project">Embedded Javascript (EJS)</a></h3>
   <p><b>Embedded Javascript is an open source, client-side JavaScript template library</b> <a href="http://ajaxian.com/archives/ejs-embedded-javascript-client-side-preprocessor">I wrote in 2007</a>. Looking back, I believe it was one of the first in-browser template libraries created.<p>
   <p>EJS was used widely and embedded in other frameworks (such as <a href="http://javascriptmvc.com/">JavaScript MVC</a> and <a href="http://aptana.com">Aptana's offerings</a>). The <a href="http://embeddedjs.com">official site for EJS</a> is maintained by <a href="http://jupiterit.com/">Jupiter IT</a>.</p>

  <h3><a href="http://www.github.com/synckit/synckit" class="project">Sync Kit</a></h3> 
        <p><b>Sync Kit (2009) caches the uncacheable -- dynamic, user-sensitive data -- in the client browser.</b>
        It optimizes web application hosting by persistently caching both relational data and static resources in the client browser, allowing the client to take over much of the processing load associated with web hosting. Here's a sketch of how it works: the nth time you visit a blog, your browser only needs to download a "data diff" against the n-1th time you visited the blog.</p>
        <p>Services such as <a href="http://blog.cloudflare.com/cacheing-the-uncacheable-cloudflares-railgun-73454">Cloudflare Railgun</a> (2012) and <a href="https://www.meteor.com/">Meteor</a> are beginning to implement this style of optimization.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <h3><a href="http://projects.csail.mit.edu/datapress" class="project">Datapress</a></h3>
   <p>Datapress is a tool for incorporating structured data into the blogging workflow. It helps bloggers link to, visualize, and share their data sets with the world.</p>

<h2>Odds and Ends</h2>

<ul class="projects thinglist">
  <li>

  </li>
  <li>
    <h3><a href="http://github.com/eob/researchy" class="project">Researchy</a></h3>
    <p>Researchy is a Batman utility belt for your Scala research code. It includes a "lab notebook" to save files and data to, timers, and git integration.</p>
  </li>

  <li><h3><a href="http://snoggle.projects.semwebcentral.org/" class="project">Snoggle</a></h3>
