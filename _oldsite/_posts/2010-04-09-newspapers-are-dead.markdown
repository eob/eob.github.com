I saw an interesting talk at CSAIL today by [Nick
Bilton](http://nickbilton.com/), the lead technology writer for the New York
Times [Bits Blog](http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/).

He talked about a lot of things -- data visualizations, the multi-tasking
lifestyle, Internet-enabled journalism. He left an impression that the New York
Times is way ahead of the curve in terms of news in the Internet Age. While
their flagship offering may still be traditional ink on pulp, they have a
fully-staffed R&D lab dedicated to prototyping new ways of finding, composing,
and distributing news with technology. For an organization that uses old
English text for its logo, that's impressive.

But what struck me as most interesting, given his position, was his
matter-of-fact attitude toward the changes in news: Newspapers will become
extinct. Maybe in five, ten, or twenty years -- whenever flexible OLED screens
become cheap enough to use instead of paper. And in the face of the
free-for-all publication platform that is the web, the traditional model of a
select few organizations providing news to the masses will likely die out too.
Yet there will always be news. And there will always be a market for news
organizations and journalists, just as there is a market for experts in any
field. They just won't interact with us the same way they do now.
