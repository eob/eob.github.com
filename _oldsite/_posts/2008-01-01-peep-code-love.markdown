I know I am just the latest of many to praise
[PeepCode](http://www.peepcode.com/), but [Geoffrey

topics in the Rails world, it is a very effective (and entertaining) way to
learn.

  homage to Seattle's famous Lusty Lady (a landmark near Pike's place, oddly
  juxtaposed next to upscale apartment buildings and boutique shops): (IMAGE

  bought my first 5-pack of "shows."
