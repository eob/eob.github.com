So far the work week is like any other, but this is the start of working half-time for the summer that I've planned to get the bulk of the Art of Rails done. I haven't been working on it lately due to a lot of stuff going on. The lack of progress is only brow-wrinkling right now, but given my upcoming deadlines the 2 extra days a week opening up are pretty crucial.

So I've got my iced tea chilling in the fridge, have my Bermuda shorts, and am ready to sit on a lawn chair in the paved paradise of Northern Virginia writing to Jimmy Buffet music for a good part of the summer. I have to admit I'm pretty excited.
