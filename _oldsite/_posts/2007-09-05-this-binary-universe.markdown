Most amazing album I've heard in a long time.

In high school my friend Susannah introduced me to the world of electronic
music with BT's early work (Ima, ESCM) and he has remained one of my favorite
artists ever since. After a many-year lull in his true electronica while he
pursued more pop-style music and remixes, this new album reminds me what made
his early music so different from anything else in the electronic section of
the music store.
