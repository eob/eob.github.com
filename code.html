  <li><h3><a href="http://www.treesheets.org/" class="project">Cascading
      Treesheets (CTS)</a></h3> <p><b>Cascading Treesheets does for web
  structure what CSS does for web style.</b> It is a lightweight
declarative annotation layer which helps you merge, split, and remap web
content.</p>

  <li><h3><a href="http://embeddedjs.com/" class="project">Embedded Javascript (EJS)</a></h3>
   <p><b>Embedded Javascript is an open source, client-side JavaScript template library</b> <a href="http://ajaxian.com/archives/ejs-embedded-javascript-client-side-preprocessor">I wrote in 2007</a>. Looking back, I believe it was one of the first in-browser template libraries created. (If you know of an earlier one, please let me know.)<p>
      <p>EJS is currently in use in the <a href="http://javascriptmvc.com/">JavaScript MVC</a> library and the <a href="http://aptana.com/cloud">Aptana Cloud</a> service, as well as having been forked and improved all over GitHub. The <a href="http://embeddedjs.com">official site for EJS</a>, as well as the code, is now maintained by <a href="http://jupiterit.com/">Jupiter IT</a> as part of the JavascriptMVC framework.</p>

<h2>Research Code</h2>

  <h3><a href="http://www.github.com/synckit/synckit" class="project">Sync Kit</a></h3> 
        <p><b>Sync Kit (2009) caches the uncacheable -- dynamic, user-sensitive data -- in the client browser.</b>
        It optimizes web application hosting by persistently caching both relational data and static resources in the client browser, allowing the client to take over much of the processing load associated with web hosting. Here's a sketch of how it works: the nth time you visit a blog, your browser only needs to download a "data diff" against the n-1th time you visited the blog.</p>
        <p>Services such as <a href="http://blog.cloudflare.com/cacheing-the-uncacheable-cloudflares-railgun-73454">Cloudflare Railgun</a> (2012) are beginning to implement this style of optimization.</p>
