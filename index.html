    <p style="margin-top: 10px; font-size: 1.1em; font-weight: bold">Hello.</p>

    <p>I am a Ph.D. student at <a href="http://csail.mit.edu">MIT CSAIL</a> advised by <a href="http://people.csail.mit.edu/karger">David Karger</a>. My research is driven by a desire to see better use of structured data on the web. I'm currently working on <a href="http://treesheets.org">Cascading Tree Sheets</a>, which does for web structure what CSS did for style. I've also done a bit of natural language processing work, which you're using whenever you talk to your Android phone. Prior to coming to MIT, I did research and development for three years at <a href="http://www.bbn.com">BBN Technologies</a>.</p>
    
    <p>Last semester I created the curriculum for and taught <a
      href="http://courses.csail.mit.edu/6.S194">6.S194 - Open Source
    Software Project Lab</a>. I moonlight as a hacker in residence at <a href="http://www.klaviyo.com/">Klaviyo</a>.</p>
