    <h1>Ted Benson</h1>
    <p>I am a Ph.D. student at <a href="http://csail.mit.edu">MIT CSAIL</a> advised by <a href="http://people.csail.mit.edu/karger">David Karger</a>. My research is driven by a desire to see better use of structured data on the web. Most of my work is on web architecture, natural language processing, and data publication tools. I'm currently working on <a href="http://treesheets.org">Cascading Tree Sheets</a>.</p>
    <p>This semester I'm teaching <a href="http://courses.csail.mit.edu/6.S194">6.S194 - Open Source Software Project Lab</a>.</p>
    <p>Prior to coming to MIT, I did research and development for three years at <a href="http://www.bbn.com">BBN Technologies</a>. I earned my B.S. in Computer Science at <a href="http://www.virginia.edu">the University of Virginia</a>.
