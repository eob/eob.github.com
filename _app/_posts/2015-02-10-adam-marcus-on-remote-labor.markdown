A few years ago, [Adam Marcus](http://marcua.net/) gave a great lecture on all things related to remote labor over the web. Friends on twitter [just brought up the talk](https://twitter.com/arthegall/status/565201471969714176) in reference to an article on the [sharing economy by Robert Reich](https://twitter.com/arthegall/status/565201471969714176), and I realized that the audio recording of it had fallen off the web.

So here it is:
