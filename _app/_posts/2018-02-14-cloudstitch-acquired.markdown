Dear friends,

I am excited to share that Cloudstitch has been acquired by
[Instabase](http://www.instabase.com/). We are beyond thrilled to be joining an
amazing group of people who share our dedication to rethinking how modern
development platforms are built.

Cloudstitch started with an audacious goal: replace server-side web
infrastructure with consumer-friendly applications. With a small team and a lot
of hard work, it’s amazing to see how far we’ve come. Today, tens of thousands
of people use Cloudstitch to manage websites and mobile apps entirely from
ordinary word docs, spreadsheets, and design files.

As part of Instabase, we look forward to pushing the state-of-the-art at a scope
and scale larger than we’d ever dreamed.

Our hearts and our gratitude go out to everyone who has supported us along the
way.

Ted

#### Postscript: What this means for your Cloudstitch projects

Cloudstitch will remain in operation and your projects will remain accessible,
but we have ceased development of new features and have scaled back our support
operation in order to focus on new initiatives at Instabase.

If you have any questions, please feel free to reach out at
hello@cloudstitch.com
