It was bound to happen one day with these new GPS and Internet-enabled phones.
First we find out AT&T has been illegally spying on US citizens, now we find
out that companies are beginning to [do it for their own personal
gain](http://kitenet.net/~joey/blog/entry/Palm_Pre_privacy/). We dearly need
someone on the hill to craft legislation that prevents companies from this type of cyber-stalking, as it can only lead to the types of societies that people
don't want for their kids.
