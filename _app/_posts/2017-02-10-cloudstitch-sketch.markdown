Last week [Cloudstitch](http://www.cloudstitch.com/) released our [Framer
Plugin](https://medium.com/@edwardbenson/use-spreadsheet-data-in-your-framer-projects-e7667c0589cf#.aebwljasb),
and this week we’re building on the designer love with the [Cloudstitch Sketch
Plugin](https://github.com/cloudstitch/cloudstitch-sketch-plugin). It lets you
duplicate and fill your Sketch designs with real data stored in a spreadsheet
shared amongst your team. Our plugin is compatible with both Google Sheets and
Excel 365.

Filling your designs with *realistic data *is important because it gives helps
you see the design as it will be in the real world, reveals edge cases, and
makes for much better demos.

But keeping your data in JSON files is no fun: they’re a pain to edit and can’t
be easily shared. Cloudstitch lets you load the data from shared spreadsheets in
the cloud instead.

### Installation & Use

Our [Github
Repository](https://github.com/cloudstitch/cloudstitch-sketch-plugin) has the
full instructions to get started. Installation is as simple as double clicking a
file, and usage is documented on the GitHub page.

### Thank You

Open Source is an amazing thing. We were able to build this plugin very easily
thanks to the [Sketch Data
Populator](https://github.com/preciousforever/sketch-data-populator) plugin and
it’s immaculately documented code. In fact — our plugin is just a forked,
customized, and branded version of theirs. We’re releasing all our improvements
under the MIT license as well and you’re welcome to remix them in turn.
