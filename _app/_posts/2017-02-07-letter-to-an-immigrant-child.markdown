Hi there.

We haven’t met, but consider me family.

I grew up in the countryside of Virginia. The fields were filled with tobacco
and corn, soy and cows. Virginians are particularly proud of their peanuts and
ham. Brunswick stew is the local soup — you’re supposed to make it with
squirrel, but everyone uses chicken. In the houses scattered across the fields,
everyone looked and spoke just like me.

My whole life has been a series of moves to increasingly urban places, mostly by
happenstance. Countryside to suburbs. Suburbs to small city. Small city to
medium city. Medium city to big city. With each move, my neighbors looked less
like me. New music, food, perspectives, jokes, fashion, sports.

And now as an adult, when I’m asked “who am I, as an American?” I realize it’s
impossible to separate my identity from these neighbors who a little white boy
from the countryside would have guessed were nothing like him. These neighbors
who speak differently, think differently, eat differently, and worship
differently.

I know how to trash talk about cricket thanks to a Sri Lankan. How to make laser
cutting art thanks to an Iraqi. What it means to be an entrepreneur thanks to an
Indian. And there could be nothing more comic book American than a trash-talking
entrepreneur cutting things with lasers, no matter what accent rolls off your
tongue.

My wife is Taiwanese, and now I have two countrysides. One in the Appalachian
mountains in America. One in the Yilan mountains in Taiwan.

In Yilan, the fields are filled with kumquats and bitter melon, rice and ducks.
Yilaners are particularly proud of their clean water and green scallions.
Niuroumian is the local soup — you’re supposed to make it with tendon-filled
beef, but I ask for pork instead. In the houses scattered across the rice
patties, nobody looks like me. And nobody cares.

Only three things actually matter when describing a person. Are they kind? Are
they empathetic? Do their actions match their words? Everything else is just a
decoration on top of that common humanity.

So we haven’t met, but consider me family.

I know that you eat some kind of soup. That it has its own funny ingredient.
That you come from a place that’s proud and a people that call themselves “we”.
But what I really care about is that I suspect you’re a good person, and that
you expect the same of me.

As you age, you’ll see a lot of people in power ranting and shouting about one
group or another. It never stops being terrifying. But the people who represent
just a slice will never be as powerful as people who embrace the whole, so long
as the whole stands together. That’s the great neutralizing math of society.

So know that during the best times, the rest of us will call you family. And
during the worst times, we will fight to defend and protect you. Undocumented,
visa, green card, naturalized, first generation — you are my America, and we
share this home together.
