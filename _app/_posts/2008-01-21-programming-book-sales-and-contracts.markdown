[John Resig](http://ejohn.org/) of the [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) world has a
really interesting post on his blog about [programming book sales and
profits](http://ejohn.org/blog/programming-book-profits/) from the standpoint
of a technical author.  The comment stream is worth a read too, with inputs
from both writers and publishers.
