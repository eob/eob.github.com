[Neil Stephenson](http://nealstephenson.com/) needs to step in and write a
novel about internet gangs. I just saw this headline:

> Scientlogy hacked by /i/, documents leaked

With the comment thread at the end of the article

> **nvrmind:** wtf is /i/?

> **wafflez:** in this case, the invasion board on 711chan.

> **altheahouse:** The chan's first wave. There is a war going on between Scientology and Anon. The smart money is on the later. Anonymous does
> not forgive. Anonymous does not forget. Anonymous does not receive. Anonymous
> delivers.
