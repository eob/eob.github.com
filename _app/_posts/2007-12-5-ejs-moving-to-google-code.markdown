The folks over at [JavaScript MVC](http://javascriptmvc.com/) have been using
[EJS](http://www.edwardbenson.com/projects/ejs) in their framework, and have
made a lot of great chances to it, so I'm going to move it over to Google Code
this week so that others can more easily track development of it and contribute
changes.
