Waltham is a wasteland, at least the part I've seen so far. 
Remember those old-west towns from your high school history book? The ones that cropped up on the side of a 
trail for no purpose other than to house
the passing settlers by and the occasional agent computing conference? Apparently I-95 is the new Rt. 66 and Waltham, MA
is such a town. 

2:00 PM. I call the Westin from the bus to ask which stop to get off at. "Oh, we're not the Westin
downtown. You'll have to hail a cab," they inform me. Whoops -- but not a problem. 

I hop off the bus at the next stop
and nearly straight into the cab behind it. It turns out to be maybe the best driveby taxicab tour of a city I've ever
had, complete with a description of MIT so concise it deserves to be in their admissions brochure: [in my attempt at
transcribing the Boston accent] 

"Tat ovah thear is MIT, wheah all te crazy smart fucks invent fucked up shit. Usually I get frequent fliah businessmen
who wanna go theah. Sit in the back ahn theah Blackberrys. Those guys, wahkaholics. They sit at Cape Cod in the summah 
wit te' fuckin Blackberrys sendin shit
on fukin email don't know how to fuckin relax. Ya kid's in the watah! Quit ya workin!" 

40 Minutes and $65 later. We
pull off the outer beltway of Boston into Waltham. "Waltham is one 'a tose business oasis
pahhks where all the companies go from MIT to build shit like patriot missiles, but tey're real quiet about it
cause ta people'd get upset. So what you gahtta do is darive 10 minutes down tis highway, see, cause tat's wheah tah
Wellesley girls ah. Radcliffe girls hate Wellesley girls."

The hotel looks like a business, covered head to toe in
green-tinted glass. After checking in I walk up and down the street to see if there was anything better to do. The
place is a ghost town. Nothing here but chain hotels, gas stations, and empty business offices. The sidewalk on the
street begins and ends randomly, as if they had excess asphalt in some parts of the road and figured it was better
than no sidewalk at all. Hotel, hotel, gas station, hotel, empty office building, rental car place. Car rentals must
be a big industry in Waltham.

The Charles river is nice, if inaccessible by foot, just past a half-finished
construction project and a giant highway bypass. The bypass is right outside my window, cars wooshing by on the
outermost beltway of Boston, but no buses. No buses or public transport comes to this side of town, the girl at the
front desk told me with the same tone of voice a doctor would use to inform a family that the operation didn't go
well and, we're sorry to say, amputation was necessary. Nearest restaurant? 10 minutes by car. So needless to say
I'm about to have the first room-service meal of my life. The hotel is beautiful; I'm sure the conference will be
interesting. But if anyone ever suggests a vacation to Waltham, MA to you, run in the opposite direction as fast as
you can...

By the way, I'm here to present a paper on Fido, a framework for information query and dissemination in
distributed multi-agent societies. It's pretty cool, if you are into that stuff, so check it out.
