I took about a month hiatus from writing (much to the frustrated grumbles of
the fine folks at [Wiley](http://www.wiley.com/)), but I've gotten back into
the groove and am preparing to turn in Chapter 8, "Playing with Blocks." One
thing that is markedly different about this chapter than the others: it's
chock-full of code. Up until this point, the book has been about design
patterns, tricks, and techniques.  Code is certainly used all over the place,
but it is only used to demonstrate the examples. This chapter is also about
design, but its about design centering around one of Ruby's unique language
features among the OO family of languages -- Procs and blocks. While it has
been fun writing text-heavy material thus far, it is really nice to read over
this chapter and see lines of code weaving in and out of the text all over
every page. It's good to get down and dirty in the code every once in a while
:) (I've certainly never examined [Ruby's C source
code](http://www.ruby-doc.org/doxygen/current/array_8c-source.html) until this
chapter..)
