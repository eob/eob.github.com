## Master a text-mode editor, preferrably vim

## Use tmux

## Keep a repository of your dotfiles

## Learn new languages, but not too many

The same goes for frameworks.

## Sleep on side project ideas to make sure they're worth it

You don't have as much time as you think you do. When you get a new idea for a side project, one that absolutely consumes you, write it down and revisit it a week---or even a month---later to make sure it's really worth it. Don't start coding in your fit of excitement.

Side projects, by definition, aren't your main focus. They're for fun, or profit, or fun and profit. So let's scope them to 20% of your time, plus a weekend-day: 16 hours a week or 832 hours per year. That is approximately a solid month of 9-5 work.

A solid month is also about what it takes to actually finish a reasonable mininum viable product to the point where you can point users to a real URL instead of just tell people at parties what you've been hacking on.

Thank about that: one side project per year. And now think about how many side projects most programmers have going at any one time. Maybe 3? 5?

1/3 time spent on three projects results in nothing complete. 3/3 time spent on one project results in something complete. You're already good at hacking. That's why you're reading a blog post like this. So I'd argue that your side-project time is better spent practicing **finishing things** instead of simply **hacking**. Do one thing well instead of three things that just end up in a folder called `ABANDONED_PROJECTS`.
