<span style="font-size: 1.4em">Hi.</span>

I'm an entrepreneur with a research background living in San Francisco.

I believe in building tools that enable others to reach beyond what they thought was possible. My work tends to focus on platforms that bridge the gap between the research world and production-ready engineering.

I got my Ph.D. in the <a href="http://haystack.csail.mit.edu/">Haystack Group</a> at <a href="https://www.csail.mit.edu/">MIT CSAIL</a> where I focused on <a href="http://edwardbenson.com/research">natural language processing and web architecture</a>. My thesis was on a declarative language called <a href="http://github.com/cts">Cascading Tree Sheets</a> that   enabled reasoning about the composition of web applications. 

All that led to a startup, <a href="https://www.cloudstitch.com/">Cloudstitch</a>, which went through <a href="https://ycombinator.com">Y Combinator</a> and got aquired by <a href="https://www.instabase.com">Instabase</a>, which is where I work now. 

I run an IoT platform called <a href="https://www.buttonjoy.com">Buttonjoy</a> as an <a href="https://beta.techcrunch.com/2015/08/17/amazons-5-dash-button-already-hacked-to-do-other-stuff-beyond-giving-amazon-money/">accidental hobby</a>.
