  A NodeJS library that provides a unified interface to fetching local and remote content.

**fetch-url** is a node.js utility that helps you fetch resources on disk or
over the web using a variety of specification styles. I wrote it because I
found myself using various different libraries depending on where a particular
"remote" resource was located, and also because I wanted a way to create my own
custom URL schemes as a shorthand for diffrent download types.

This library supports the following ways of specifying what to be fetched:

* **File paths** on disk
* **URLs** over the web
* **Github URLS** in the form of `github://user/repo/path/to/file`. It will download the current HEAD version.
* **JSON blobs** that can specify a number of options, including mode (binary, utf8) and URL context (to resolve relative URLs).
