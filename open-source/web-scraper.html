  A NodeJS library that scrapes a web page and all its dependencies, rewriting
  the web page to used those cached copies.
---

**web-scraper** is a NodeJS utility that helps you scrape an HTML page and all
its linked assets to disk. It will also rewrite references to those assets
inside the HTML to point to the new relative versions that have been scraped.
In this way, it is much like the "Save as Archive" mode of most web browsers,
but you can use it programmatically.

This project depends on [fetch-url](fetch-url.html).
