    Although New York Sen. Hillary Clinton won the largest states...her
    presidential campaign spent the rest of the week repositioning her as a kind of
    underdog…This week, Clinton and her advisers declared that Obama is the
    “establishment” candidate…It’s hard to exaggerate the distance between
    Clinton’s previous image and her new underdog image.

Peter Overby, NPR News, 8 Feb 2008

What really puts a bad taste in my mouth is the way in which the Clinton
campaign doesn’t see reality as the summation of past actions, but rather as a
marketing campaign that can be whatever they pay money to brand. “Oh, now the
voters want something new now? That’s OK! Yesterday we were the voice of
experience, but today we’ll be the voice of the outsider!” What was it that
George Orwell write about? Memory holes?
