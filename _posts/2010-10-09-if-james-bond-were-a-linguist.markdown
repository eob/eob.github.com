MIT is hosting the [2010 Empirical Methods in Natural Langauge Processing
conference](http://www.lsi.upc.edu/events/emnlp2010/) this year, and I noticed
a clustering of papers in the program that would make for a fun session,
possibly titled "Linguistic Security". The session would cover both offense
(what can we tell about you from the language you use) and defense (how can you
hide messages in your word choice).

Since the EMNLP program is already fixed, the "2010 Ted's Blog Workshop on
Linguistic Security (TBWLS)", will have to suffice :).

Here's the program. Each item is taken from the [real
program](http://www.lsi.upc.edu/events/emnlp2010/program.html):

*   Keynote: Why do we call it decoding?<br />
    Kevin Knight
*   Improving Gender Classification of Blog Authors<br />
    Arjun Mukherjee and Bing Liu
*   Modeling Perspective using Adaptor Grammars<br />
    Eric Hardisty, Jordan Boyd-Graber and Philip Resnik
*   Practical Linguistic Steganography using Contextual Synonym Substitution and Vertex Colour Coding<br />
    Ching-Yun Chang and Stephen Clark
*   A Latent Variable Model for Geographic Lexical Variation<br />
    Jacob Eisenstein, Brendan O'Connor, Noah A. Smith and Eric P. Xing
