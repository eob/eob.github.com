Ah, the fresh smell of paper pulp! An unexpected box in the mail containing
twenty copies of The Art of Rails can mean only one thing — the book has gone
to print! For the sake of getting things done, only two observations:

*   I really need to finish up this W. Web story, but I’ve been dragging my feet ever since I ended up starting a war!
*   All of the Wrox authors really need to get together and make a pact to send in menacing pictures for their book covers. That way the book store can place the Wrox books across the isles from each other and it will look like different topics in computer science are staring each other down.
