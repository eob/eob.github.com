    One part of the Clinton mystique maintains: Deep down journalists think she’s a
    political Rasputin who will not be dispatched. Prince Yusupov served him
    cupcakes laced with cyanide, emptied a revolver, clubbed him, tied him up and
    threw him in a frozen river. When he floated to the surface they found he’d
    tried to claw his way from under the ice. That is how reporters see Hillary.
