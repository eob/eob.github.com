### 3. Roast the Cocoa

*   Roast `60g of cocoa nibs` @ 350 for 5 minutes

Watch out -- these things burn fast! I ruined the first batch when I wasn't
attentive enough to a funny, almost burning plastic smell coming from the oven.
The nibs come out almost as bitter as when they went in, but much chewy-er.

### 2. Make Some Cocoa Tea

Bring to a boil with `400g wholefat milk`, turn off the heat, cover, and let
steep for about 10 minutes.

### 3. Junk the Nibs

Strain 'em outta there.

### 4. Custard it Up

In a bowl, mix `two whole eggs` with `80g sugar`. Add it to the milk, stirring
with a whisk. Put the temperature on low heat, and stir constantly, scraping
the bottom, until you reach custard consistency. You know you're there when a
spoon dipped in comes out with a thick coat, but swiping a finger across the
spoon leaves it clean. When you decide it's time, immediately transfer the pot
into a bath of ice water to stop the eggs from cooking.

*Watch out*: if you overdo this step everything will get grainy and lumpy. *But
fear not*: I suck at this step but the result remains delicious in spite of me.
You really can't fail when the main incredients are cream and sugar.

### 5. Chill Out

Let the custardy milk cool down. I put it in the refridgerator or outside (in
the winter). Or in the freezer if I'm already late to a party.

### 6. More Cowbell

Once it's cool, mix in `200g heavy cream`.

### 7. Churn baby, churn.

The machine knows what to do.

Enjoy with a few nibs on top.
