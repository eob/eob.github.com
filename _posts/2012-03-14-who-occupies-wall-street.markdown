I participated in the Cambridge get-together of the nationwide [Occupy Data
Hackathon
2](http://www.occupyresearch.net/2012/03/24/photos-from-occupydata-hackathon-2-day-2/)
this weekend. Lots of interesting people, projects, and analyses going on.

Here's [the visualization I whipped
up](http://www.edwardbenson.com/viz/occupy.html), which lets you browse the
results from the [Occupy Research General Demographics and Participation
Survey](http://occupyresearch.wikispaces.com/file/view/OccupyResearch+Survey+Guide+and+Instrument.pdf),
and the
[post](http://www.occupyresearch.net/2012/03/24/faceted-browsing-of-orgs-data/)
on the [Occupy Research](http://www.occupyresearch.net] blog that linked to it.
The data was cleaned up by [Charlie DeTar](http://tirl.org/) of the Media Lab,
and he also has a great -- and much higher-fidelity -- visualization of it
[available here](http://orgs-facet.tirl.org/simple.html). The code for both is
available on [GitHub](https://github.com/yourcelf/orgs-facet).
