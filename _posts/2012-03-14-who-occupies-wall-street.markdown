I participated in the Cambridge get-together of the nationwide [Occupy Data 2
Hackathon](http://www.occupyresearch.net/) this weekend. Lots of interesting
people, projects, and analyses going on.

Here's [the visualization I whipped
up](http://www.edwardbenson.com/viz/occupy.html), which lets you browse the
results from the [Occupy Research General Demographics and Participation
Survey](http://occupyresearch.wikispaces.com/file/view/OccupyResearch+Survey+Guide+and+Instrument.pdf).
The data was cleaned up by [Charlie DeTar](http://tirl.org/) of the Media Lab,
and he also has a great visualization of it [available
here](https://github.com/yourcelf/orgs-facet).
