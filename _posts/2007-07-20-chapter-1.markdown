As chapters are turned in, I plan on posting a little bit about each one. Since
I can't publish the content of the chapter (ps, you can download the new Harry
Potter at this link `<a href=http://##$.'@03##CARRIER LOST`), I'm instead
releasing a short story-esque blurb that makes sense in light of the chapter.
So here you are, Chapter 1:

> W. Web knew immediately something was wrong.
> 
> He had suffered stomach pangs before, but never like this. Stumbling out of
> the taxi cab and into the hospital, he mopped the sweat from his brow and
> pushed his way across the sidewalk traffic. Inside everything was a dizzy
> blur flowing past him. Nurses, patients, a police officer. Several computer
> technicians hitting a computer monitor and mumbling something about the
> Intranet going down.
> 
> "I know, I know!," Web thought as he struggled past them for the emergency
> patient entrance. Luckily for W. Web this particular hospital works on a
> triage system, and when you explain to the nurse at the front desk that you
> are the Internet you get bumped to the front of the line.  There's a lot
> riding on your health.
>
> As the Web lay in his hospital bed, passing other familiar technologies as
> the nurse pushed him down the hall, he realized that he had made the right
> decision to stop ignoring the pangs. It was going to be OK.
