Calling all hackers, designers, and journalists in Boston!

A friend and I are organizing a "Crowdsourcing for Community Service" hackathon
at MIT Friday-Sunday January 14-16. It should be a fun time and we would love
for you to come out and join us. 

All the details, and a signup form, can be found on [the
website](http://www.crowdcomputingchallenge.info/). 

We're trying to get a group of creative people together for a weekend to try to
solve a community service problem using mobile and crowdsourcing technology. 

How often do you think: "If only we could each pitch in a small bit, the world
would be a much better place." Well, let's get together, brainstorm a bit
(Friday), create a tool or platform that helps us each pitch in that little bit
(Sat & Sun), and then use it to better the Cambridge and Boston communities!

We're interested in people of all skills that could contribute to a project
like this, whether you're a hardcore web hacker, a graphic designer, a writer,
or a community organizer. 

Hope to see you there,

Ted
