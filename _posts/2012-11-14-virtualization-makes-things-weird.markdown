title: Virtualization Makes Things Weird

Ah, for the simple days, when a taxi was a taxi, and my video games weren't
helping terrorists behind my back.

*  Exhibit A: [Johnathan Zittrain on Ethics Laundering via Mechanical Turk](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqnQTEhP0Pc&feature=plcp). 30 minutes but worth the watch.
*  Exhibit B: [We're not a Taxi Service; We just connect riders to cars](http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2012/11/lyft-sidecar-and-uber-all-slapped-with-20k-fines-from-ca-regulator/) 

We've begun to virtualize many parts of the economy. And things are getting
weird as a result. 

Take the case of these new peer-to-peer taxi services popping up. It's a cool
idea, for sure. But we also agree that regulations are usually a Good Thing,
providing they're used to protect consumers instead of simply raising the
barrier to entry of local business (see: [Why It's Illegal to Braid Hair
Without a
License](http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2012/06/22/155596305/episode-381-why-its-illegal-to-braid-hair-without-a-license)).

But how do you regulate a *virtualized* taxi livery? A company that provdes
taxi-like services without actually owning cars or employing drivers? They just
play switchboard for anyone who wants to sign up.

There's a game in Japan called
[Pachinko](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tRclMW6YqQ).  It's also weird. I
can't figure it out, despite having spent a good hour trying in Kyoto this
summer. Pachinko involves shooting BB-gun sized metal balls into a [Galton
Box](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bean_machine) of sorts, in which you receive
points for certain landing positions.  As best as I can tell, the configuration
of the game creates a calculable expected return for every possible angle from
which you shoot these balls. This means the game boils down to (A) guessing
what these expected payouts are and (B) holding your wrist at precisely the
angle that achieves them.

Anyway, the point about Pachinko is, it's gambling. It's a [billion dollar
business](http://spectrum.ieee.org/tech-talk/consumer-electronics/gaming/the-secret-life-of-pachinko).
Except for a small problem: you can't gamble in Japan. To avoid the
prohibition, they've taken Chuck-E-Cheese style gaming to the next step.

1.  You give Pachinko money
2.  Pachinko gives you points
3.  Points can be redeemed for toys, and (here's the kicker)
4.  Coincidentally, next door is a shop that purchases toys for money

It comes full circle.

Anti-gambling law avoided. Gamblers, proceed.

Virtualization is weird. 

One might argue that the financial crash of 2008 was a result of the same
song-and-dance. I can't figure out how to concisely make the proper allusions
here, but [The Big Short](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Big_Short) is an
excellent read if you're interested.

I have some friends who are lawyers. They tell me the interesting thing about
the law is that every case is a story, and the job of the court is to interpret
that story in the context of existing law and precedent. Initially this
frustrated me.  Doesn't this guarantee inconsistent outcomes? Can't we just
have a giant lookup table? 

*  Section 3.4.5: An Eye.
*  Section 3.4.6: A Tooth.

But, seeing how fast things change, and how strange things get when companies
virtualize our daily activities past the point where the law, as written, can
address them...well, it makes me glad the courtroom involves stories, instead
of a simple dictionary look-up.
